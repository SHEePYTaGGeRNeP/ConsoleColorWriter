# ConsoleColorWriter
ConsoleColorWriter

Write clearer text to console with colours.

Works out of the box, no initializing necessary. Just call the static methods (CCW.Write ) everything is setup already.

You can of course change all the colors being used by the methods by changing the properties ( ex: StandardBackColor ).
